# A todo list

### Quick start

To get started:

Ensure you have node and postgres installed then,

Start your postgres server: `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres`

In a new tab run: `git clone https://github.com/shouston3/pgtodolist.git && cd pgtodolist && npm i && npm start`

Then visit `localhost:4000` to get see the todo list

### What

A very basic example of a todo list using:
* postgres
* hapi
* handlebars

### Why

I need to practice using postgres and making a simple todo app is a great way to practice
